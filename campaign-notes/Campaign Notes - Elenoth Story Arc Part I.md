# **Campaign Notes \- Elenoth Story Arc Part I**

## **Introduction to the World**

Endon is a world setting for a Dungeons & Dragons campaign, featuring a consistent structure, geography, and calendar system across multiple adventures. This document chronicles the lore and events that have shaped its history, beginning with a campaign spanning its Eastern and Central continents.

## **The Central Continent**

### **Crisis in Chaptain**

In the human city of Chaptain, located in the lowland plains of the Central Continent, halflings were treated as a subservient class. They lived in burrows outside the city walls, exchanging their labor for the humans' protection. One such halfling, Ander Underbrush, worked in the potato fields of a cruel noble named Taskmaster Turdor.

One day, Turdor entered the fields and began whipping the halfling workers to make them work faster. In response, a halfling threw a potato at him, earning a lash from the whip. Another threw a stone, which struck Turdor in the head and killed him. When the town guard arrived, chaos erupted. Though he had not participated in the initial attack, Ander was accused of murder. In a rage, he fought back, killing a guard before being subdued.

Ander escaped to the halfling burrows but was soon turned over by his own elder to prevent collective punishment from the mayor of Chaptain. Though his family attempted to buy his freedom, and a local cleric named Colm pleaded for his life, the mayor refused clemency. Ander’s life was spared, but he was banished from Chaptain, to be killed on sight if he ever returned.

### **Refuge in Lebno**

With no other recourse, Ander traveled to the small port town of Lebno. The port consisted of a single tavern, the Mist's Milk, run by a sharp-witted Haren-gon named Milo. In the confusion following Taskmaster Turdor's death, Milo quietly assumed full control of the tavern. She hired Ander, providing him with room and board in exchange for work on the docks. It was a difficult but quiet life, and a marked improvement over the fields of Chaptain.

While in Lebno, Ander was occasionally visited by Colm, the cleric from Chaptain. Colm belonged to the church of Jalenwa, the god of bounty and life, and his mission was to provide for the needy. He often traveled to Lebno to trade for goods to support the poor in Chaptain and to check on Ander's well-being.

## **The Eastern Continent**

### **The Caliopans of Caliopis**

The Eastern Continent is a frozen delta plane, home to the Caliopan centaurs. Their main settlement is Caliopis, and their language is Despeech, known to outsiders as Caliopan. Their culture is communal, with no concept of personal property.

A key cultural ritual is the "sapling pulling," a rite of passage for young male centaurs to attract a mate. Suitors are judged on the size of the tree sapling they can pull from the frozen earth, a testament to their strength.

### **The Centaur Twins and the Dwarven Expedition**

Dimblerf and Blackbriar were twin Caliopan siblings. During a sapling pulling competition, Dimblerf was challenged by his rival, Toplun. Dimblerf won the challenge, and in his shame, Toplun challenged him to a fight. The twins used magic—a skill unknown to most Caliopans—to defuse the situation and embarrass Toplun.

Shortly after, the twins discovered a dwarven ship that had come ashore. The dwarves, led by Bullion Goldtooth, treasurer to the Baron of Baron's Bluff, had been sent from the Central Continent to prospect for precious metals and gems. Unfamiliar with dwarves or the concept of ownership, the centaur twins raided the ship by night, stealing metal tools and other wondrous items.

Eventually, the twins revealed themselves. A language barrier prevented communication until Dimblerf, blessed by the nature god Petpetor, found he could understand the dwarves' speech. Learning of the Central Continent, the twins were seized by a desire for adventure. They struck a deal: in exchange for the dwarves' lives, the centaurs would accompany them back across the ocean.

## **The Adventure Begins**

### **Convergence in Lebno**

The dwarven prospecting boat, now carrying Bullion Goldtooth and the two centaurs, arrived at the port of Lebno. The sight of the centaurs was a spectacle for Milo, Ander, and the other patrons of the Mist's Milk. By this time, the twins had learned the basics of the common tongue from Bullion during their sea voyage.

While the newcomers were settling in at the tavern, the port was suddenly attacked by a pack of vicious dire wolves. The wolves seemed intent not just on livestock, but on killing the town's inhabitants. The party's four future heroes—Dimblerf, Blackbriar, Ander, and the recently-arrived Colm—stepped into the fray and drove the beasts off.

### **The First Quest**

Fearing the wolves would return, Milo offered the group a reward to clear them out of the region for good. She suggested they might find the wolves' den near Lone Mountain and Far Lake. The party accepted the mission. Guided by Dimblerf's connection to the god Petpetor, they set off from Lebno and ventured into the surrounding forests. It was there that they had their first encounter with the elves, a tribal people native to the woodlands of the Central Continent.
